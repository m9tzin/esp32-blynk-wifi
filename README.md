## How to connect an ESP32 to Blynk and Thingspeak code 
 
#### About our project
 Our project, using an ESP32 and a Servo, would initially create a self-replenishing feed mechanism for domestic pets. With that, came the challenge of connecting an ESP32 via the Blynk app to use the platform and at the same time integrating the data into ThingSpeak.
